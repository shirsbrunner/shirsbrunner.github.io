## Hi
I UX-Consultant working for ELCA Informatik SA during the working hours, but I often can't let go of design topics during the rest of the day. 

I'm better at doing the X than the I of everything related to U. That said, I feel at home in the whole user centred design process. Also I try to increase accessibility in the things I touch.

I have a background in marketing, media science, computer science, marketing, media research, business consulting, user experience, accessibility.

When I'm not working I like to hit the playground, cook, build little kids LEGO dreams, visit friends and family, travel to near and far away places where I try to take lots of pictures with a DSLR, look after our plants at home, read a lot of books, make mustard, design mainly digital things like this page (done in eleventy) or fonts only I will most probably ever use (in fontforge) or draw brand-images to put on other things or design invitations, stickers or layout books for myself (all in affinity products), have something printed for real, drink real espresso and enjoy the sun among other things. 

## Why is this in english
If you know me or you read what I've written on this page, you also know that english is not my first language. I'm pretty sure, that this page is full of errors, be it spelling, grammar or anything else a native speaker might have learnt in scholl.

However, whenever I programm anything, my mind tends to switch to english - I don't know why. Given enough temporal distance, I might change this into the prosaic wonder (similarly full of errors) it might be given it is in the language I normally speak. For everyone just speaking english (or at least understanding it): I promise to also add more pictures.
