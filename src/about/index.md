## Hello again
I am a UX-designer working for Puzzle ITC during the working hours. I often can't take my hands off of design topics during the rest of the day. 

I believe that design has a profound impact on peoples lives and that good design can make a difference, not only in looks but even more so in interaction. 

I'm currently more focused at doing the X than the I of everything related to U. That said, I feel at home in the whole user centred design process. In addition, I try to increase accessibility in the things I touch.

I have a background in marketing, media science, computer science, marketing, media research, business consulting, user experience and accessibility.

When I'm not working I like to hit the playground, cook, build little kids LEGO dreams, visit friends and family, travel to near and far away places where I try to take lots of pictures with a DSLR, look after our plants at home, read a lot of books, make mustard, design mainly digital things like this page (made with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)) or fonts only I will most probably ever use (in fontforge) or draw brand-images to put on other things or design invitations, stickers or layout books for myself, have something printed for real, drink espresso and enjoy the sun among other things. 

## Things to look out for
I promise to add more pictures.
