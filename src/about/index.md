## A bit of Background
I am a digital designer, working for [we are cube³](https://wearecube.ch), the UX-division of [Puzzle ITC](https://puzzle.ch). I also like to be inspired by other design disciplines – like print, type, fashion, architecture – and to create things during the rest of the day.

I believe that design has a profound impact on peoples lives and that good design can make a difference, not only in looks but even more so in interaction. That said, I like things to be open and freely accessible and prefer a better thing to a prettier one.

I'm currently more focused at doing the "X" than the "I" of everything related to U. That said, I feel at home in the whole user centred design process and like to stretch in all directions. In addition, I try to increase accessibility in the things I touch.

I have some degrees in marketing, media science, computer science and have worked in a lot of fields including media research, business consulting, user experience and accessibility. I've also been cutting grass in the mountains using a scythe ages ago, distributed newspapers in the morning hours or worked on a supermarket checkout. 

When I'm not working I like to cook, build little kids LEGO dreams or cardboard armour, visit friends and family, travel to near and far away places where I try to take lots of pictures, look after our jungle at home, read a lot of books, make mustard, design mainly digital things, like this page (made with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)), the odd computer game or fonts only I will most probably ever use. I like to draw brand-images to put on other things, layout stuff for invitations, flyers or books for myself and other people, create stickers, have something printed for real, drink espresso, enjoy the sun and sometimes play the violin. 

## Things to look out for
Where are the pictures...?

## Regarding content
This was once supposed to be some sort of work portfolio – it turned into a a log of personal projects.
I believe this goes without saying: please ask me, before copying or selling things you find on this website.
