## This page is not tracking anything (that I'd be aware of)
Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer. But I believe there is nothing to say here - I collect nothing, measure nothing and can't hence use nothing to do anything... but maybe someone else does? Notable things: 
- This page is built in eleventy. I don't believe that eleventy is in any way collecting data. [Learn about eleventy here](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- This page does no longer use fonts from fonts.google.com due to GDPR concerns. Two great fonts [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat) and [Courier Prime Code](https://quoteunquoteapps.com/courierprime/index.php) (with a custom WOFF-transformation for serving without further changes) are now served locally. 
- This page is served from Github. I don't think that there is something, but you never know: [Github privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)


So, if you find something, let me know and I'll try to fix this.
