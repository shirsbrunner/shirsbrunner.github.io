## Current status
This website intends to meet all level A and AA success criteria of WCAG 2.2.
There should no be bigger issues present. However there are some issues that I need to fix:
- Header and Footer perform badly on screens smaller than 320 (or zoomed in). 
- Typographic previews have a text that is for visual purposes only. 
- The webapps linked from the articles (cash counter, obliques, digidies) most probably have issues with accessibility (alt text, tabbing).
Also, I can't guarantee, that 3rd party links lead to accessible content. 

## Report an issue
If you find any accessibility issues on this website, or have ideas for improvement, please send me a message on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@simuh) and I'll try to fix it.
