## It's this time of the day again
Trying to build the page once and simple and things and fluid, mobile, you hear me...
But remember, this page is basically already fluid :) could just be better :) 

## Internet for the win
Links you might be using again: 
- [What's this all about](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2015/12/07/creating-fluid-layouts-images-with-css.html) This explains the fluid CSS options to set width automatically
- [Fluid W3c-grid](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_grid.asp) This contains the grid spec, if we were to use the CSS-Grid-Style - should work in most browsers nowadays
- [Fluid type](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/) This (and even more so the next) are (were?) advanced moves to adjust the typo (smaller screen? smaller typo)
- [More advanced fluid type](https://css-tricks.com/simplified-fluid-typography/)
- [EM and REM](http://www.intensivstation.ch/css3/em-rem/)
