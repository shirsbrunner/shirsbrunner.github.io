## MOOOORE

Also: eventually I'll have to think about a better structure for blog entries... they tend to get lost rather quickly. 

Also: eventually I'll have to think about a better navigation between blogs - maybe something using arrows and stuff...

Also: what about accessibility? maybe I should check this out...

Also: some copyright and stuff would be mint

Also: the page-icon is missing

Also: add a way to include pages...

(c) Turns out, this is now a todo list..
