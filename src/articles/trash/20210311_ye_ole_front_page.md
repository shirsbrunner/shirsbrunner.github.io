## Intro

This is a Page to try out Eleventy. 

There is a tutorial - we are at **Process Images with JavaScript Templates**
on [this page](https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-with-eleventy/) - well actually we already have css, but no images.
So, this might be outdated. 
See blog-Posts for further info. 

Currently styling css-things and trying out basic styles.
Also Visual Studio Code for the win (even though you can't copy paste pages)

## Important moves

- Starting the server (let's not look this up 24/7)? 

> npx eleventy --serve

- Nunjucks? Ah - maybe it's already installed with eleventy?... - else 

> npm install nunjucks

- The nav? install with 

> npm i @11ty/eleventy-navigation --save-dev

- Never forget to save...

- development-Mode: 

> set ELEVENTY_ENV=development

- It's easier using Visual Studio Code
