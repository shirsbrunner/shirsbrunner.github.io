## Akari
If you've ever been in Japan, you might have noticed thousands of paper lanterns in entrances to little shops, sushi places, ramen restaurants and also in the street during festivals. Paper lanterns have a tradition of over 300 years. In different places, different lamps are assembled. Gifu paper lamps are famous, producers have a long tradition. The lamps give off a nice warm light, the paper screen works very well as a diffusor. 

The trade of lamp making has been in the spotlight in the west, ever since Isao Noguchi reused the process to create his Akari light sculptures. Reusing old forms, but also introducing different shapes, his goal was to bring a piece of his design in every household in the world. 

The lamps have ever since been ubiquitous, IKEA has built their own lines (we have at least three different types from different series at home) and similar lights are ever since in all lamp shops you can think of visiting. Since the lamps change, it's hard to get a different similar one to one already in existence. And paper lamps are prone to breakage, with and without kids helping in the process. 

This entry describes an attempt to copy an existing paper lamp and gives an introduction in how they are most probably built. Assumption: most of them are still built by hand, despite the differences in price. There is a huge difference in quality in paper lamps, but even the cheapest ones sold are most probably better in most regard than the outcome of this experiment. 

## Assembling a lamp
Building a lamp takes some time. Some of the steps can be seen in [this video by vitra on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ8SbDJ7Cck) showcasing most of the steps. There is a lot more to the process, additional videos on youtube can give you hints on things I missed. 

Base for the lamp is a frame defining the shap of the lamp. A skeleton is draped over the shape. The skeleton can be spring like structure or a series of rings. Depending on the design, the structure is reinforced using string (especially for hanging lamps to reduce tension on the paper). Paper is glued to the frame using rice starch glue called Sokui. A light source and depending on use case additional things (like feet, hanger, paintings, lacquer...) are added to finalize the lamp. 

More detail on the different steps in the following chapters.

### Base
The base defines the final shape of the lamp. It consists of two discs holding up multiple "ribs". The more ribs in the base, the more even designed the shape of the lamp. Lamps with less ribs tend to be more random in outcome. Based on the videos, the base is normally built from wood. Wood is sturdy enough and since the base can be reused, it is well worth the investment. The ribs can't be wider than the diameter of at least one of the discs, the discs themselves define the top / bottom openings of the lamp. 

In the project, the base was built from cardboard. For size I tried to match the shape of the other lamp. Issues with calculations (cough, cough) led to the a slightly bigger lamp than intended (something I'd correct in a followup). I was going for a six ribs setup. Cardboard is not as sturdy as wood, and there was some folding under tension leading to some little distortion.  

### Skeleton
Normally bamboo is used - but how to slice bamboo? Store bought lamps sometimes also use wire. 
For this lamp I bought thin rattan (each around 1.5-2 meters long). Rattan has to be soaked before using, else it starts to break easily. 
Hopefully, the tension on the rattan is big enough to give a stable lamp. 
For attachment to the lamp a piece of wire has been added (on top and bottom). 

Where necessary, two pieces of rattan have to be pieced together. Unfortunately, the Sokui was disolving the paper initially bought - therefore I switched to using super glue for the joints.

### Paper
The paper normally used for the lamps is called Washi paper - made from mulberry threes. Unfortunately, I couldn't initially get the paper and bought a paper similar in appearance that didn't tolerate wetness very well. It disolved when trying glue rattan together or when trying to attach it to the frame.
Second try using rice paper (Danxuan). While it is a bit more stable, it tends to rip easily when wet but is strong again, when dry. The following process led to a nice enough outcome: 
- Adding the Sokui (See below) to the skeleton using a brush
- Draping the paper over the skeleton
- Wetting the paper with water using spray bottle
- Cutting / ripping the edges using a razor (didn't work so well with the Danxuan paper - while it seems to be an easy task in the videos, it's tricky in reality and resulted in a mostly ripped look)
- Letting it dry for some time

Since then I found a source for Washi-Paper (or Japanpapier as it's called in the store in question). The paper is a bit stronger when dry (and also more expensive). To be seen if the process is easier.

### Sokui
Sokui is a rice glue used in different crafts in Japan. It can be used to stick paper and wood together. Examples for usage include furniture or weapon making (glueing wood) and papercraft. Apparently Sokui can be softened using steam or water and is friendly to the things it glues together. In this project, Sokui is used to attach the paper to the skeleton.
 
The glue is made out of rice starch. Different types of rice yield different outcomes. An initial batch using Carnaroli was less successful, Basmati was easier to work with (finer grains). One of the sources was especially mentioning sushi rice for its sticky quality. Better tasting rice yields better outcomes (well... not sure about this one).

Recipe: boil rice until soft, mash, pulp, strain through a sieve and use it within a week. Can be stored in the fridge but not frozen.
