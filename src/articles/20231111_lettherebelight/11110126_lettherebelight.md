## Akari
If you've ever been in Japan, you might have noticed thousands of paper lanterns in entrances to little shops, sushi places, ramen restaurants and also in the street during festivals. Paper lanterns have a tradition of over 300 years. In different places, different lamps are assembled. Gifu paper lamps are famous, producers have a long tradition. The lamps give off a nice warm light, the paper screen works very well as a diffusor. 

The trade has been in the spotlight in the west, ever since Isao Noguchi reused the process to create his Akari light sculptures. Reusing old forms, but also introducing different shapes, his goal was to bring a piece of his design in every household in the world. 

The lamps have ever since been ubiquitous, IKEA has built their own lines (we have at least three different types from different series at home) and similar lights are ever since in all lamp shops you can think of visiting. Since the lamps change, it's hard to get a different similar one to one already in existence. And paper lamps are prone to breakage, with and without kids helping in the process. 

This entry describes an attempt to copy an existing paper lamp and gives an introduction in how they are most probably built. Assumption: most of them are still built by hand, despite the differences in price. There is a huge difference in quality in paper lamps, but even the cheapest ones are most probably better in all regard than the outcome of this experiment. 

## Assembling a lamp
Needs a frame (see youtube)
Built from cardboard. Size: approximately similar to the other lamp. 
Issues. Cardboard folds under tense rattan, thus there was some little distortion.  

Normally bamboo is used - but how to slice bamboo? Store bought lamps sometimes also use wire. 
For this lamp I bought thin rattan (each around 1.5-2 meters long). Rattan has to be soaked before using, else it starts to break easily. 
Hopefully, the tension on the rattan is big enough to give a stable lamp. 
For attachment to the lamp a piece of wire has been added (on top and bottom). 

Where necessary, two pieces of rattan have to be pieced together. Unfortunately, the Sokui was disolving the paper initially bought - therefore I switched to using super glue for the joints.

## Paper
The paper normally used for the lamps is called Washi paper - made from mulberry threes. Unfortunately, I couldn't initially get the paper and bought a paper similar in appearance that didn't tolerate wetness very well. It disolved when trying glue rattan together or when trying to attach it to the frame. 

## Sokui
Sokui is used to attach the paper to the frame. 
Glue made out of rice. 
Can be used to stick paper and wood together. 
Recipe: boil rice until soft, mash, pulp, strain through a sieve and use it within a week. 
In this project, it is used to add the paper to the rattan skeleton.
