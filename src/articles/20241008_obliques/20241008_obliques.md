## Oblique strategies

Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. 
Mainly for music. Was thinking about doing my own set for ages. 
Note an official (?) set can still be bought on the store. There are however a lot of implementations. The most basic ones write the prompts on a set of cards. 

## Thoughts and adapting 

I assume, the cards have deliberately been "no-frills" - only the text should help over a writers block. Hence, using a design as neutral as possible.

However... The typeface, the haptics of the paper, the colour of the paper, the colour of the text all add some sort of quality and meaning to the message. When printed on playing cards, do I get different outcomes compared to a set printed on quality-paper using letterpress?

The same most probably is true for the language. Using the original set of advice, does the fact that it's given in english change the outcome for me as a non native speaker? Does having to think about the word and potential misunderstandings change the outcome? Probably more than the quality of the print. 

I decided long before the current implementation on using a swiss german translation.

## PWA again

I kind of love creating little PWA's. Therefore obliques is another PWA to have handy on my phone.
