## Typeface-Info
This was initially made in affinity designer and then in fontforge. The current version is an upgraded one from glyphs. This was simple to space and kern, then again, I didn't know a lot about kerning and spacing.

The typeface had some sort of pixel look first (I thought). But later I learnt, that it does not allign very well to pixel grids on smaller sizes and that pixel typefaces are built completely different.

## Things to look out for
This was supposed to be the (in retrospecitve) bold for Segunda Neue - but they kind of don't match very well anymore. Maybe I'll fix this, or make both into a variable font in the future.
