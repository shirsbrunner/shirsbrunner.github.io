## Building a static page

While browsing the web I stumbled over the topic of static page builders. [Eleventy or 11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is one of these "pipelines" that build a static page out of templates and allow to add articles and pages using easy documents in simple markdown language. 
As a former computer science student I was eager to try out the mechanism as apparently it was "simple" enough for someone as rusty as me. 

Since the 11ty-page does not really cater to the rusty programmer or eager noob, I was looking up some tutorials. In case you want to start something like this, be aware, that it is not to hard, but neither to simple. Obviously buying some space on wordpress.com would make your life easier. 

Also, I'm pretty sure I'll have to look up everything again and again if I ever try to change something on this page (looking at you accessibility).

Try it out, you will learn a lot if you do!

## Why would you want a static page

Well, it's more or less free (if you don't value lots of your time) and you get to learn something while fooling around in text editors. You can easily change everything you want without having to pay additional things (looking at you wordpress - want to remove something small from the page? Pay more).

Since it does not need a database, it is very easy on ressource-need. Hence you can get away very cheap with hosting. You can host your page for free on github, if you like and link the blog to your own domain. I'm not sure about the limits, but I feel that you can build a pretty big blog - the only limit is the build-time. 

## Ressources that might help you get started
This is by no means a final list. You'll need more things, but this will help you get started. 

- [Eleventy or 11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- While you can easily build this in notepad++ I recommend getting something like "visual studio code" - you'll find the link on the search engine of your choice
- To get some explanation, start from the very beginning and understand more than if you just copy a boiler (see next), I suggest following [this page](https://tatianamac.com/posts/beginner-eleventy-tutorial-parti/) and [that page](https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-with-eleventy/)
- Markdown-hints to add content to your page - [look no further](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- It might be handy to start with the correct boilerplate (a base, already built for a certain purpose). You want a blog? [Start with a blog-template](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). 
- There are tons of basic infos about all the coding and language, look for flexbox, the grids, css-stuff on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com). I also very much like [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
