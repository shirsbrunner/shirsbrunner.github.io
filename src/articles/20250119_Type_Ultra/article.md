## Replacing type

Lately I've been playing around with more "experimental" typefaces. However, sometimes I feel like building something more usable. As I mostly make flyers and invitations, I still use a lot of display type, while having nothing usable in the direction. 

Looking at my page, I decided to try to replace Montserrat for the headings. Here is a first draft of some display-like type. The vision behind the typeface is something with more heavy pixels. In hindsight, what initially came out of the process was something similar to Impact – I've been adjusting this, playing with character width and also adding some serif here and there.

Somehow (and this is something I noticed before), I struggle more with uppercase than lowercase. Maybe it depends on where I start when drawing the typeface. 

## It's a bit further now

It is still missing polish, punctuation, and special characters. Now with more Serifs, all over the place.
Also, adding serifs ate the first kerning table and intraletter-space is still a bit of a challenge, but it's getting better, I hope.

Summary: I really like the a/b/d/p/q/r shapes.
