## Replacing type

Lately I've been playing around with more "experimental" typefaces. However, sometimes I feel like building something more usable. As I mostly make Flyers and Invitations, I still use a lot of display type, while having nothing usable in the direction. 

Looking at my page, I decided to try to replace Montserrat for the headings. Well, here is a first draft of some display like type. The vision behind the typeface is something with more heavy pixels. In hindsight, what came out of the process is something similar to Impact – I'm probably going to change this, or maybe add some Serif. 

Somehow (and this is something I noticed before), I struggle more with uppercase than lowercase. Maybe it depends on where you start when drawing the typeface. 

## It's a first draft

This is missing polish, punctuation, and special characters. Now with more Serifs, all over the place.
Also serifs ate the first kerning table...


{%include 'partials/textsample.njk' %}

{%include 'partials/typographic-link.njk' %}

I'm not really sure about the lowercase "y", but I like the a/b/d/p/q/r shapes.
