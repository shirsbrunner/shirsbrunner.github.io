## Divide by two and add again

Pretty sure I could come up with additional titles for "slicer" my newest experiment in typography. This time inspired by a picture of some badly combined halfes of a sticker containing the brand of "double cola" (that I have neither tasted nor heard of before). Interesting enough, the upper half was perfectly aligned with the lower half, but shifted by more or less half a letter. 

While this looks as strange as it sounds, I'm amazed, that it is still readable. Brains tend to know how to read the upper half, but also the lower half, furthermore matching everything together. 

## To hard to imagine? Look at this

{%include 'partials/textsample.njk' %}

{%include 'partials/typographic-link.njk' %}

## Things
- Still needs special characters. However the easy reading works mainly with text...
- Diacritics are now distanced from the letters
- Does not need kerning
- I have an idea what to use this for... but this might still take some time.
