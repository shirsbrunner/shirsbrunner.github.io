## Stamps 

I've been thinking about making stamps ever since we went on a trip around the world. When visiting Galapagos, salt lakes full of flamingos, the easter islands, tierra del fuego and other places, frequented by tourists, there is often and option to get a fancy stamp for your passport. Why not make one for yourself (and your invention of a fancy nation)?

Passports normally (used to) have entry and exit stamps for visas, today, visas are sometimes issued digitally or not at all (i.e., when crossing the border between Schengen countries). The passport maybe gets a sticker or something similar.

It's apparently not without risk adding novelty stamps to a passport. People have been prevented from boarding flights and had to get new passports before being able to travel further.

But hey, it can still be used to stamp books, patterns on fabrics, cards, parcels and everything else you can think about. It's also fun with kids. 

## Material
There is the potato-stamp option, but these are probably not durable enough and also don't really are a good enough option for stuff with lots of details. 

I've been playing around with linoleum plates for postcard prints. The material is however rather hard to carve and tricky to print without a press. Also the ink might not be suitable for craft projects with little kids. 

There is however a lot of different rubber-blocks. Rubber is a very soft material, that can be carved using the same tools as the other options above. Due to it's softness, there is hardly a danger for the hands. and the material holds fine details. Depending on size, a small inkpad is enough to make stamps on paper. 

## Copying a desing to rubber
While it's easy to print stuff on paper, rubber seems tricky. Using a dab of acetone it's however very simple, to transfer a laser print to a piece of rubber: 
- Print your desired motive to paper
- Cut it out and place it facedown on the rubber
- Using a cotton pad, dab the backside of the paper with acetone. Part of the toner will stick to the rubber
- Start carving
Handily, this also directly mirrors the print thus making it easy to make text prints. 

## Carving
Carving precise lines is harder than I thought. I normally carve the outline of the print (i.e., the black stuff from the transfer stays, the rest has to go). i don't cut the whole rubber assuming, that this gives the stamp more durability and stability.
