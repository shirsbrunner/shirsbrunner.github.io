## Stamps for special moments
I've been thinking about making stamps ever since we went on a trip around the world. 

Passports normally (used to) have entry and exit stamps for visas, today, visas are sometimes issued digitally or not at all (i.e., when crossing the border between Schengen countries).

Also interesting, when visiting Galapagos, salt lakes full of flamingos, the easter islands, tierra del fuego and other places frequented by tourists, there was often and option to get a fancy stamp for your passport. 
Why not make one for yourself (and your invention of a fancy nation)? Well, it's apparently not without risk adding novelty stamps to a passport. People have been prevented from boarding flights and had to get new passports before being able to travel further.

But hey, stamps can still be used in books or to create patterns on fabrics, cards, parcels and everything else you can think of. It's also a lot of fun with kids. 

## Materials for stamp making
While there is the well known potato-stamp option, potato-stamps are not durable and also don't really are a good enough option for stuff with lots of fine details. 

I've previously been playing around with linoleum plates and even wood for postcard prints. The material is however rather hard to carve and tricky to print without a press. While gouache works, the ink recommended is not suitable for craft projects with little kids. 

There are however also rubber-blocks. Maybe you have been carving erasers into stamps during school? Rubber is similar in density and hardness – a very soft material, that can be carved using the same tools as the other options above.
Due to it's softness, there is hardly a danger for the hands. and the material still holds fine details. Depending on size, a small inkpad is enough to make marks on paper. 

## Copying a desing to rubber
While it's easy to print stuff on paper, rubber seems tricky. The easiest method to bring your prints to the rubber is a toner transfer method. Using a dab of acetone it's simple, to transfer a laser print to a piece of rubber: 
- Print your desired motive on paper using a laser printer
- Cut it out and place it facedown on the rubber
- Using a cotton pad, dab the backside of the paper with acetone. Part of the toner will stick to the rubber. 
- Wait until it's dry
- Start carving
- When finished glue the rubber on a piece of wood, use an inkpad and start stamping

This also directly mirrors the print thus making it easy to make text prints - no need to mirror the design. 
Not all printers seem to work equally well - the outcome most probably depends on heat applied during printing and also on toner. 
I noticed, that using to much acetone can disolve details to much. But a lot can be fixed while carving. 

## Carving
Carving precise lines is harder than I thought. I normally carve the outline of the print (i.e., the black stuff from the transfer stays, the rest has to go).
I don't cut through the whole rubber assuming, that this gives the stamp more durability and stability. 
Cutting an incline supposedly results in a more durable stamp where details are less prone to break away. 

## Outcome

The following image shows a carving of the Hirschelbrummbär. The size is 4.5cm x 4.5cm.
I used an old brother printer (black & white only).

## Missing things
- The printing gives a pattern, maybe from the inkpad.
- Not sure, if sanding the block leads to better outcomes
- I'll have to try different Inks
- More stamps
