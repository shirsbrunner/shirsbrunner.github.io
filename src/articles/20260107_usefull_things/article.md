## Making tools
I once read, that people with enough experience make their own tools exactly to their needs to excel at their craft. Well, I'm not sure, if I'm there yet, but this part of the log might eventually go in this direction. I like making digital things, some silly, some to play and some for work. This is a list of the more useful things for reference. 

## Cash Counter
Counting cash to show a meetings cost. Multiply time, cost and people. 
<div class="cta">

</div>

## DigiDice
Need some digital dice? Here you go.

</div>

## Dimensionalizer
Measuring the dimensions of a digital screen. Quick app because my prefered service for these things disappeared into the void. Sometimes I need a client to send me a screenshot with the dimensions of their browser window for reference. This only has the bare minimum (as most other things like pixel density or user agent string ar either not necessary or don't work in the relevant browsers).

## Obliques
Stuck and speaking swiss german? This translates oblique strategies into Mundart.
