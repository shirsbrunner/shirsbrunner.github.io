## Typeface-Info
I'don't remember, if this originated as a silly idea or in a different project. It has this alien vibe and I use it for graphics things to fill space now and then. 

## Things to look out for
To kern or not to kern - this is a monospace thing (apart from punctuation) but I could adjust glyphs here and there.
