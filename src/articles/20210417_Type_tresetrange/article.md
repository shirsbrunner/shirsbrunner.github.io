## Fontforge again

While thinking about printing on textile and patterns, the idea to make something font related crossed my mind. Not wanting the text itself to distract too much from the other aspects of the future design, but also not adding gibberish (in case someone asks), I decided to make some experiments with a new typeface - obviously that typeface had to be created from scratch...

## The goal

Since I didn't know what it would look like, if I'd like the idea and if I'd change everything again, the typeface had to be "low effort". Not too many glyphs, only some things for text, smooth and easy. 

## Process & Learnings

I drew the capitals on a piece of paper while doodling and quickly decided to make this an all caps typeface. To design the characters, I used the same process already tested with the segunda typeface: affinity designer again - with the same basic template, grid and character sheets. I also used the standard typeface-base in fontforge again. 

While trying out the typeface in a browser, I liked the outcome and decided to add some additional characters (like punctuation marks) to make it more fun. 

## The result

In the end I added all the glyphs again, the hardest part was inventing the numbers, also interpunction and special signs tend to look like a mess of dots...

The following paragraph shows the outcome with some "cupcake ipsum" text: 

{%include 'partials/textsample.njk' %}

{%include 'partials/typographic-link.njk' %}

Obviously, this might not be usable for anything but art, jokes or the alien-text of your choice. Still it is interesting, that I can still make out words (not numbers) just by looking at text (try to find Muffin and Love).
