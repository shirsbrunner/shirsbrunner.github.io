## You can feel it in the nose

Have you ever tought about making bread, gave up because you didn't find the time and then suddendly the pandemic gave you a lot of opportunities to express yourself dough-wise? Similar things have happened to lots of people around the world. Fortunately I'm lucky to have someone who can make better bread than me. Other products like hot sauces have been taken care of by my brother in law (and we still have our own habanero-oil that might now be considered "aged").

Not that I was looking, but when I noticed that you can make your own mustard (and let me tell you, I was not the only one thinking that it's a tricky process), I was ready to go. Getting the ingredients was easy and really making the mustard too. The first batch was made with 50% black 50% yellow mustard seeds. It was easily possible to make an orange-flavoured version in addition to the "normal" version. The hard part was giving the product a name and creating a label that would convey it's superior quality...

After a creative process spanning multiple weaks, in the end the brand Hirschlbrummbär was born. In hommage to the german mustardmaker "händlmaier" and my own name.

Next time, I'll go with a lighter version or try a whisky or beer-mustard.

Drop me a line, if you want the recipe or try it yourself, there are plenty of pages in the internet.

PS: in case you were wondering: this is also, where the "stag-bear" in the upper left is coming from.
