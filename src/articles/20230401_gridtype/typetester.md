## Typeface-Info
Can be used both vertically and horizontally. Whitespace, punctuation, everything is a dedicated glyph â€“ like in other typefaces, but it's very visible here. I use this for icons, backgrounds and initially made it to print something on fabric. 

## Things to look out for
Vertical text still does not work on firefox very well, maybe I'd have to open a bug for this once.
