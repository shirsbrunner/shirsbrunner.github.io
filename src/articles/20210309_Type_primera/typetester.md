## Typeface-Info
The easiest way to start a typeface? Just digitize your handwriting. Written on paper, directly digitized in fontforge, this was running out of the EM-Square, because I tend to write with big ascenders and descenders. This version is an adjusted version updated in glyphs. My prefered glyph is the first one in the sample.  

## Things to look out for
The visual weight could need some more tunig. Also, this has so much potential for ligatures, maybe I'll update it again (see the liebe heide typefaces). Also, a typeface, where this morphs into a sans serif font? One can dream.
