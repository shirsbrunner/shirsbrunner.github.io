## Typeface-Info
Based on blackletter-typefaces, mainly rotunda style, but adjusted for usage in todays texts (with less flourish). It's rounded to give it a more friendly look - think roses instead of wolves. 

## Things to look out for
This is not really finished yet, spacing, kerning, but also glyphs I'm not happy with.
