## Typeface-Info
After square typefaces, why not make something round? Using circles and geometry did seem like an easy idea. This is the third iteration (with bigger circles). This typeface (well a different version) is used on the page. 

## Things to look out for
Can be optimized using optical trickery and still has some spacing / kerning issues here and there.
