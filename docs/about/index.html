      <h2>Hello again</h2>
<p>I am a UX-designer working for <a href="https://wearecube.ch">We Are Cube</a> the UX-division of <a href="https://puzzle.ch">Puzzle ITC</a> during the working hours and I also like to create and play with things during the rest of the day.</p>
<p>I believe that design has a profound impact on peoples lives and that good design can make a difference, not only in looks but even more so in interaction. That said, I like things to be open and free and prefer a better thing to a prettier one.</p>
<p>I'm currently more focused at doing the X than the I of everything related to U. That said, I feel at home in the whole user centred design process. In addition, I try to increase accessibility in the things I touch.</p>
<p>I have some background in marketing, media science, computer science, marketing, media research, business consulting, user experience and accessibility. I've also been cutting grass in the mountains using a scythe ages ago and distributed newspapers among other things.</p>
<p>When I'm not working I like to hit the playground, cook, build little kids LEGO dreams and cardboard armour, visit friends and family, travel to near and far away places where I try to take lots of pictures with a DSLR, look after our jungle at home, read a lot of books, make mustard, design mainly digital things, like this page (made with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">eleventy</a>), or fonts only I will most probably ever use (in fontforge or glyphs). I like to draw brand-images to put on other things, layout stuff for invitations, flyers or books for myself and other people, create stickers, have something printed for real, drink espresso and enjoy the sun among a lot of other things.</p>
