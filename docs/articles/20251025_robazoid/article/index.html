      <h2>Making computer games</h2>
<p>I've been making silly computer games for a long time. I still have a copy of a game with a jumping sheep protagonist I made as a kid (in some game studio I don't remember the name of with sprites and art made in Paint and Photoshop). I remember multiple games and changes to games made during computer science studies (Sheeps and wolves, Ursuppe, Snakes and ladders - command line among others).</p>
<p>Then around spring / summer 2014 while looking for jobs, I programmed the first instance of robazoid unity. What's still available on the net is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA_EibAH0K8">the promo-video for the appstore</a>. In hindsight, the start is a bit tricky to watch (it shows the controls in an overlay, that disappears and is not shown again until toggled on). The game was deliberately designed to be very hard to master, after I read an article explaining the success of &quot;flappy bird&quot; by hooking people with random gratification.</p>
<p>Well, robazoid was removed from the appstore by google, since I didn't / couldn't update it anymore. Unity was developing faster than I could develop the game. Furthermore, versioning in unity was a pain. At the moment of removal, google also closed down my developer account (since I had no app anymore). This is something I don't really understand, but can't do nothing against.</p>
<p>Robazoid is still running on my phone, but who knows for how long... As the kid likes playing it now and then, I was thinking about rebuilding it, even better this time. After the experience with google I wanted no major gatekeepers, the new game should run anywhere and be installable without the apples and googles of this world. I also didn't want to use unity anymore due to versioning pains.</p>
<h2>The lure of the pixels</h2>
<p>Ideally, the new game would run on a retropie or batocera home setup and be playable on the TV with any controller available. Looking for potential platforms, I found some very nice, small environments that catered to pixel nostalgia. Why not make something that could have run on a gameboy? It became clear, that I want to make a retro game with pixel art.</p>
<h3>Pyxel</h3>
<p>First, I tested the <a href="https://github.com/kitao/pyxel">pyxel engine</a>. Something like pyxel (or pico-8 that it was based on), looked like a simple enough choice. I was drawing sprites and setting up basic movement and text display, when the kid looked over my shoulder.</p>
<p>Drawing stuff and also pixel people is something, kids love to do. I had him draw characters on paper and added these to pyxel, where I made them move using arrow keys. Seeing the characters animated was fun, however, trying to run a proof of concept on the raspberrypi with batocera, it turned out, that run options were limited to batoceras non-raspberrypi-setups (i.e., on other linux machines).</p>
<h3>Godot</h3>
<p>Hence, I decided to switch to something else. Looking for further platforms, I found <a href="https://godotengine.org/">godot</a>, another game engine. Godot is similar to unity, opensource, and has a big following and lots of documentation. While this does not work with batocera either (well, maybe it does... version 3.5 hat someone ported runtimes), it is way less limited in run options than unity, or pyxel.</p>
<p>Luckily, there's a ton of information in the internet. Make no mistake, godot is not easy to use and needs a lot of getting used to. Some things are not very well organised. There are a lot of hidden things, nested menus and special setups that need to be kept in mind. The good, and that's the thing that sold me: you can just use git on the folder your game runs in. Until now, it seems to work like a charm, all changes and links made in the editor are converted to text by the engine. All programming could be done in simple text and versioning code or text is perfect for git. Getting a stable git setup is something I never managed to do in unity on the free plan, and the main reason I lost the source for the robazoid.</p>
<h2>Projects when kids are involved</h2>
<p>Projects are a bit harder with kids. Kids have lots of everchanging ideas and goals, and both change quickly. Every impression can change their desires or their current top goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similar to working with a client with no vision or planning, scope management is one of the most important parts of development with kids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, and this is mainly true for our own projects, sometimes we can just expand the product and pivot everything into something new.</p>
<h3>Making it more fun</h3>
<p>Thus, after seeing Elsa in the movie &quot;Frozen&quot;, instead of one playable character, we had to add Elsa as a main character. What about the initial character (the rabbit in the thumbnail)? Well, I kept it. The game now has a character selector at the start of the game and it's possible to switch between the two.</p>
<p>Initially both characters had the same moves and changing character meant changing aesthetics only. Obviously, this was rather boring. Now characters can be switched in the game during a run. Sometimes, they even have to be switched to reach certain things. Currently, the rabbit can shoot plasma and Elsa can create ice blocks to change the environment.</p>
<p>While changing and implementing these things is a lot of work, it leads to richer games. Instead of a simple jump'n run game, the game is now some puzzle platformer. It also led to better understanding and refactoring of the game's code architecture and programming in general (and a lot of patched up code in some cases). I've been revisiting singletons, factory patterns and so on just to implement some of the functions.</p>
<h3>Little beta testers</h3>
<p>Kids are not only good at coming up with fresh ideas, they are also splendid beta test partners. They tend to try things, that you don't try yourself. However, they also don't notice anything odd. Ice cube in a strange position? Game over after a single hit from an enemy? Everything part of a kid's expected experience. Even the game crashing is completely normal, so supervision of testers is advised.</p>
<h2>Topics without stakeholder intervention</h2>
<p>Kids are mainly interested in playing a game. Drawing sprites is fun, seeing these sprites in action is even more fun. But there are other things when making a game that are best made without the stakeholder looking over your shoulder.</p>
<h3>Learning the game engine</h3>
<p>A new program is always a bit of a learning curve. Watching videos and reading tutorials helped a lot and led to discover best practice patterns. Implementing these took a lot of refactoring. What was an easy scene initially, had to change due to the player switch or a multi level approach or enemies able to shoot things or a game over screen or a simple hud with a menu structure. There is a lot of ways on how to do certain things and I guess, there will be a lot more to change and refactor again and again.</p>
<p>I can't stress this enough: What I like a lot in Godot is being able to use git for versioning on the game folder. So far it has been very easy to check different versions against each other, branch on risky refactoring and do some resets when everything falls apart.</p>
<h3>Games have a lot complexity</h3>
<p>Strange things happen all the time while playing a game that might, or might not be related to the game engine. Collisions trigger multiple times or the position of a sprite is a bit off (by 0.024 pixels) hooking the player character in place. These things lead to bugs and keeping track of all these is not an simple task. I use a trello board to track features and bugs and keep a bit of focus.</p>
<h3>Sprites</h3>
<p>Part of the sprites used are based on kids drawings. These and everything visible is optimized by myself. I guess the look could be more polished, but I like doing everything in a project like this, instead of copying or grabbing other peoples work, art, sound or typefaces. It's easier in the longrun to adjust things a little bit, get a consistent look or just do things your way.</p>
<p>I don't build programs to build ressources however. For sprites I've been checking programs and ended up on Pixelorama that is also built in the Godot-Engine. It supports simple animation and allows me to build spritesheets. There are some things I miss however - merging multiple animations frames into one spritesheet. Still, everything visual in the new game is made in Pixelorama (apart from the fonts).</p>
<h3>Music and sound effects</h3>
<p>The first Robazoid never had sound effects. Something I was planning to fix, but never managed to. Pyxel however had a beat machine built in (it's a lot of fun using MML music language apparently) - I suggest trying it out just for the music part alone - it's a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Sadly I couldn't export sound out of Pyxel or interpret MML in godot. The current workaround is garage band (I use a mac) with the <a href="https://ymck.net/app/magical-8bit-plug-en">YMCK magical 8 bit plugin</a>. YMCK is also available on other platforms should I ever decide to move away from a mac again. Garage band is not easy to use without a real midi controller (piano keys), but I managed to add some simple soundeffects for drops, shooting lasers and spawning ice blocks.</p>
<h3>Typefaces</h3>
<p>My previous typefaces did not work very well to a pixel environment (even the early ones that were very geometric). The reason is found in font rendering of pixels where the letters are antialiased (i.e., not sharp) due to not matching the pixel grid or not enough hinting (i.e., matching the fonts geometry to pixel grids).
Well, it was time, to make a pixel font, a plan I had ever since I've seen a talk by Marcin Wichary (<a href="https://aresluna.org/">check out his page</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDI8ubVZi7w">talk about pixel fonts</a>).</p>
<p>The result is Pixelorama8. The font is best used at 8 px (thus the 8 in the font name)</p>

<p>Sidenote... As the game is low resolution, the first font was as big as the player char, and still not compressing nicely on lower resolutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>speak after me: a pixel is a pixel is a pixel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to scale the whole game to use 16px sprites to make the font smaller in comparison. Turns out, this was rather easy to apply in godot (just double everything, but I had to redraw / scale all the sprites).</p>
<p>Smaller resolutions need smaller typefaces. Apparently can go down to 4 px (well, there is a 2 pixel font, but it's tricky to read) - we will see, what we need in the future.</p>
<h2>The Todo-List</h2>
<ul>
<li>This currently only works on my machine from Godot - export this to something more public on where it can be played.</li>
<li>Hopefully there is some way to play this on batocera or retropie... but the internet will do as well... Godot can push to the web - so maaaaybe on this page?</li>
