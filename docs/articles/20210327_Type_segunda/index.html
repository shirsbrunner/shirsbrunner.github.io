      <h2>The goal</h2>
<p>After digitizing my own handwriting in what eventually became a font called &quot;Primera&quot; (that I have yet to upload to any place) I took a break and restarted with typography after reading some books and articles on the topic. I became aware of the fact, that lack of knowledge in the field of typography and typesetting was hindering my development in lots of things related to visual design.</p>
<p>To bridge that gap a little bit, I decided to create an additional font. This time I'd not use something handwritten to get a something more professionally looking. I decided to create a quadratic monospace typeface, where every letter would use/need the same space. The result should have been a display typeface usable in horizontal or vertical direction similar to japanese Kanji-signs. Initially I wanted to only create a capital alphabet and use it's geometric base to create different weights for different applications.</p>
<h2>Process &amp; Learnings</h2>
<p>I had the intention to use fontforge again, after learning about the software in the attempt to create the first typeface. Knowing the drawing-tools, I decided to rather create the font in affinty-designer and import SVGs into fontforge. This led to it's own issues and I learnt, about the importance of pixel aligning everything (even the artboard), to get an acceptable result.</p>
<p>During creation I added lowercase-letters and deviated from the idea to create a monospace font. The geometric base I initially used was not really suitable for all letters and I had to redraw everything again and again (resizing lowercase letters twice). Also descenders going out of the EM-Square posed some problems and I decided to redraw everything again.</p>
<p>Due to the basic structure with the individual glyphs it was easy enough to import everything into fontforge quite quickly.</p>
<p>The hardest part were hinting and kerning. Kerning in a geometric font is harder than kerning the handwriting. Hinting (not an issue in the handwritten font, it's glaringly obvious in a geometric font) again is a different kind of challenge. While kernig is by no means ideal it is good enough to be passable. Adding manual hints is a thing I gave up eventually after reading more on the topic.</p>
<p>This is also where I eventually deviated from creating multiple font weights from the same base - it just didn't look good enough. I suppose there needs to be a different structure (similar to italics), but I'd like to read more on that topic. Also: variable fonts - it's the current big thing (but apparently not supported in fontforge).</p>
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>In the end the font has more than 170 letters or signs and can apparently be used in a multitude of languages from Albanian to Zulu (if I can trust font squirrel). The font is used in this page for technical things, copyright-notice and decorations. Initially I wanted to used it as the font for titles, however after going with what I use now (Mono Black)</p>
<p>The following image is a screenshot of the outcome of the font squirrel webfont creator. The real font is less fuzzy.

<p>It is always fun, to use your own creation replacing every other font in your browser (and helps to find issues with the typeface).</p>
<p>I suggest trying out fontforge for simple things. I'm currently thinking about additional typefaces - maybe an icon-font.</p>
