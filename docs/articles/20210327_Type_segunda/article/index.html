      <h2>The goal</h2>
<p>After digitizing my own handwriting in what eventually became a typeface called &quot;Primera&quot; (that I have yet to upload to any place), I took a break from typography.</p>
<p>I only restarted after I became aware of the fact, that lack of knowledge in the field of typography and typesetting was hindering my development in lots of things related to visual design. Also, I wanted to educate myself a bit and started reading some books and articles on the topic.</p>
<p>To bridge that gap a little bit, I decided to create an additional typeface. This time I'd not use something handwritten to get a something more professionally looking. I decided to create a quadratic monospace typeface, where every letter would use/need the same space. The result should have been a display typeface usable in horizontal or vertical direction similar to japanese Kanji-signs. Initially I wanted to only create the capital alphabet and use it's geometric base to create different weights for different applications - I was also looking at variable fonts.</p>
<h2>Process &amp; Learnings</h2>
<p>I had the intention to use fontforge again, after learning the software in the first steps in typography. Knowing (and not liking) the fontforge drawing-tools, I decided to rather create the font in affinty-designer and import SVGs into fontforge. This led to it's own issues and I learnt about the importance of pixel aligning everything (even the artboard), to get an acceptable result.</p>
<p>During creation I added lowercase-letters and deviated from the idea to create a monospace font. The geometric base I initially used was not really suitable for all letters and I had to redraw everything again and again (resizing lowercase letters twice). Also descenders going out of the EM-Square did pose some visual problems and I decided to redraw everything a third time.</p>
<p>Due to the basic structure with the individual glyphs, it was easy enough to import everything into fontforge quite quickly to keep me motivated.</p>
<p>The hardest parts were hinting and kerning. Kerning a geometric typeface is harder than kerning handwriting. Hinting (not an issue in a handwritten typeface, it's glaringly obvious in a geometric one) again is a different kind of challenge. While kernig in segunda (the name of the second font) is by no means ideal it is good enough to be passable. I gave up adding manual hints eventually, after reading more on the topic (it's very tricky, apparently operating systems can do it good enough in open type fonts).</p>
<p>At this point I also eventually deviated from creating multiple font weights from the same base - it just didn't look good enough. I think there needs to be a different structure (similar to italics), but I'd like to read more on that topic. Also: variable fonts - it's the current big thing (but apparently not supported in fontforge).</p>
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>In the end the typeface has more than 170 letters or signs and can apparently be used in a multitude of languages from Albanian to Zulu (if I can trust font squirrel). The typeface is used in this page for technical things, copyright-notice, tags and decorations. Initially I wanted to used it as the font for titles, however, after trying it out, I decided to go with what I initially designed this page (Mono Black).</p>
<p>The following paragraph shows the outcome with some &quot;cupcake ipsum&quot; text:</p>

<p>There are still some issues to be fixed, but the &quot;my baby-effect&quot; is strong.</p>
<h2>Try it!</h2>
<p>It is always fun, to use your own creation replacing every other typeface in your browser (and helps to find issues with the typeface).</p>
<p>I suggest trying out fontforge for simple things. I'm currently thinking about additional typefaces - maybe an icon-font.</p>
