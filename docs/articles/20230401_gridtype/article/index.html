      <h2>Currently more of an idea</h2>
<p>I've been trying to come up with an idea for a typeface that works in all directions - similar to japanese writing. The issue with our alphabet is the irregularity of shapes with decenders, acenders, lower case, upper case and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While square or circular frames solve the problem they have issues with the rhythm or density of black and white.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After visiting the Haettenschweiler-Exhibition at the ZHdK and some inspiration regarding typefaces I decided to start another approach. Disclaimer: this is a rather quick and unfinished one... (lots of glyphs are missing, there are some strange artifacts in the vertical examples - however these seem to be firefox only - the vertical text looks better in chrome or safari)</p>
<h2>Learnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>space, punctuation and so on all need a square shape - sometimes, this makes text tricky to read. maybe it would be feasible to create ligatures with punctuation and space to not have double whitespace at the end of every paragraph</li>
<li>readability is really hard with the approach taken</li>
<li>adding new elements to a constructed approach makes it hard to remain consistent - the same also applies to the whitespace-glyphs that appear way more elegant than the blocky letters.</li>
<li>this can be caps-only (because lower case would have the same size as upper case)</li>
<li>kerning begone - everything has the same shape</li>
<li>It's probably not possible to create this in glyphs mini (or maybe it is since I don't need vertical kerning or spacing)?</li>
<li>now... how to turn the draft 90° to show the vertical text? Solution CSS: &quot;writing-mode: vertical-lr; text-orientation: upright;&quot; - however, this does not look good in firefox (better in chrome though - however, then spacings are off...). <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/in/fonts/using/open-type-syntax.html">Adobe</a> lists some issues with the open type stuff (See &quot;Note: about vertical features&quot;). this issue seems to be related to the problems with placing the &quot;space&quot;-glyphs. Update: this seems to be an issue with &quot;text-orientation:upright;&quot; - Regarding vertical writing modes see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#vertical-modes">W3C-Spec</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#intro-text-layout">this on the same page</a> probably answers the question: bi-orientational fonts - but, how to set a font as bi-orientational?</li>
<li>There is indeed a &quot;dropleft&quot; for japanese (and probably a &quot;dropright&quot; for mongolilan) as seen in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#block-flow">W3C-Spec</a></li>
<li>Another <a href="https://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/vertical-text/paper">paper as html-page</a> with a nice writeup of the topic and what could be improved for the organization of online layouts for different scripts with additional information in unicode</li>
<li>It's really hard to make an uniform wall of text, where content breaks wherever possible ignoring everything that is added to browser logic (including the merging of white-space using css: &quot;white-space:break-spaces&quot;). This also includes breaking words in any place (using css &quot;word-break: break-all&quot;), between whitespace, between word and whitespace (appears to be working with &quot;white-space:break-spaces&quot;), between word and punctuation (css: &quot;line-break: anywhere&quot;). In fact it needs all three (?) to actually break everything. Now... if this was just possible in a desktop-publishing software...</li>
</ul>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>should special characters like &amp; or # be considered letters, whitespace or something else? What about / or %?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results of the draft</h2>
<p>The following paragraph shows the outcome with some &quot;cupcake ipsum&quot; text:</p>

<h2>Also...</h2>
<p>I think this has some amazing potential.
Would pages consisting only of vertical text be horizontally scrolling? Most probably yes.</p>
<h2>Investigating some things november 2023</h2>
<p>An additional issue is currently visible on this page. Sometimes, flexbox for the writing-mode:vertical-lr and text-orientation:upright containers is not working properly. This is based on the fact, that, similar to the dropdowns, flexbox behaviour changes if writing-mode changes (on the container). See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-flow-property">w3.org-flexbox documentation</a> for details (it's a bit further down). Currently, I'm not sure on how to handle this. Also - somehow, firefox reacts with reorganizing the flexcontainer when opening inspect mode...</p>
<p>Furthermore firefox (not chrome / safari) seems to be doing something strange to the space character in the vertical-lr/upright text. While an empty space is placed, where the character would be, the character itself is shifted a bit. I'm not sure, if this is related to the typeface or a browser text rendering issue.</p>
<h2>Small update december 2024</h2>
<p>This now has a different sample-text (among with all other articles for typography). I decided to change the vertical-text example to just one. &quot;writing-mode: vertical-lr&quot;, flexbox and multiple columns next to eachother just don't seem to work for the purpose, when mixing different writing modes in a page. I might have been close with block-size and inline-size (where it's possible to limit the height of the vertical paragraph) – but I ran into another problem with flexbox, where flex-elements reacted as if their content was just one line, breaking the layout of the page.
The space-character-bug in firefox is still here however and chrome still adds bigger spaces between the characters with text-orientation:upright.</p>
